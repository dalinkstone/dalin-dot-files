# dalin-dot-files
these are my dot files that I am currently using on my personal and work Macbooks. i have chose to run Omakub by DHH on my personal desktop because it meets my needs and makes good use of the hardware. this is for if i want to change my desktop setup in the future and also for every single computer i will hereafter ever set up.

## installation
i will need to create an installation script that can handle almost all of the install work. the script will have to incorporate a TUI to make it an enjoyable experience and nearly automated. 

## features
i will post screenshots here of what each piece looks like and what the highlights of the config are.
